# Complex Local State Management

This repository demonstrates how to manage complex local state in Flutter.

Introducing an additional class that exposes calculated values from global state and local state will help make widgets focus on building UI and clarify its dependency, and the complex logic can be tested independently.

For more details about this handy idea, refer to [docs/local_state.md](docs/local_state.md).
